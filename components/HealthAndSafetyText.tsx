      Foraging Warning This app is not intended for foraging. Many edible plants
      closely resemble toxic ones. The AI may not always accurately distinguish
      between species, as its learning is based on the images it has
      encountered. Always prioritize safety and do not rely on the app to
      determine whether a plant is safe to consume. Leave Only Footsteps Enjoy
      nature responsibly by minimising your impact. While it's exciting to
      identify plant species, always consider whether it's worth the potential
      harm. If the plant could be damaged in the process, it’s better to admire
      it from a distance. 2. Safety Considerations While Using the App and
      Exploring Nature Leave No Trace Principles: While in nature, we encourage
      you to follow the "Leave No Trace" principles, which include disposing of
      waste properly, respecting wildlife, and being considerate of other
      visitors. Stay Safe Near Waterways: Never risk your safety for a photo.
      Water temperatures can be deceptively low, even on warm days, and depths
      can be hard to judge. Maintain a safe distance from water, cliff edges,
      and slopes leading to water. Limit Physical Contact with Plants: Many
      plants in the UK can be harmful, causing anything from skin irritation to
      more serious health risks. Avoid picking or touching plants to protect
      yourself and the environment. Respect Wildlife: Do not remove animals from
      their natural habitats, even temporarily. Transferring animals, even from
      one pond to another, can spread diseases that are harmful to wildlife.
      Ticks: Ticks are common in nature, and carry many diseases, most notably
      lime disease. Make sure to wear clothes that cover the skin, and tuck
      pants into socks when walking in tall grass. Always check for ticks after
      spending time outdoors. Stay on Marked Trails: Where possible, staying on
      designated paths and trails to protect both the environment and personal
      safety. Prevent Contamination and Zoonotic Diseases: Protect both yourself
      and wildlife by using hand sanitiser regularly while exploring. Never
      transfer plants, animals, or other natural elements between environments,
      especially aquatic life, to prevent the spread of disease. Weather and
      Sunset Awareness: Always check weather conditions and sunset times before
      heading out. Unexpected weather changes and darkness can pose significant
      risks. Avoid Trampling Vegetation Some plants thrive in dense vegetation.
      If capturing an image means trampling plants or risking exposure to
      nettles and ticks, it’s best to reconsider. Preserve the natural
      environment by Enjoy nature and advocate for it’s protection lets ensure
      that we protect nature for many generations to come
